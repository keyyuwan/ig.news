# ðŸ’» Project:

The project is basically a blog, with paid signature option that gives you access to all the posts content. <br /> <br />
You can also authenticate with Github (made with nextauth). <br /> <br />
The posts are written using a CMS (Prismic). <br /> <br />
To deal with the paid signature, I used the Stripe API. <br /> <br />
To verify if the user has an active paid signature to give him access to the posts, I used FaunaDB.
